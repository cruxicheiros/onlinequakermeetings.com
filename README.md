# onlinequakermeetings.com
Source code for an directory of online Quaker meetings.

The first goal for this website is to be a simple list of online meetings and discussion groups. It will later be updated with:
* Search functionality
* Guides to using chat software used for meetings (Zoom, Discord, Skype, etc.)

It should contain information like the physical 'locality' of the online meeting/discussion group, what software is used to run meetings, and when those meetings take place.

Want to contribute? Please make sure any code contributions work on old devices and slow connections (standards pending) and keep an eye on [WCAG accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (this project aims to reach AAA standards, the standard set for government websites).

To get your meeting added or suggest features, make an issue on Github or email me at clarkseanor@gmail.com.

Cheers!

Clark
