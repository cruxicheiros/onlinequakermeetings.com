    <h2>Meeting house websites</h2>
    <p>
        If you already attend a Quaker meeting, a good way to find out if it holds online meetings is to go on your meeting's website. Many meetings have up-to-date websites and will list information about how to join them online there.
    </p>

    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <p>
        Many meetings keep members up to date using <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. If you're struggling to find an up-to-date website for your meeting and have a Facebook account, try searching for the name of your meeting on Facebook and seeing if anything comes up, or checking any related Facebook groups you're already a part of.
    </p>

    <h2>Country-specific resources</h2>
        <p>
            Some countries have resources that act as directories of Quaker meetings in their country. These country-specific pages contain links to those.
        </p>
        <div class="directory">
            <ul class="country-list">
                {% for country in countries %}
                    <li>
                        <a href="/findmeetings/{{ country.code }}">{{ country.name }}</a>
                    </li>
                {% endfor %}
